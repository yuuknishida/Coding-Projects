# About: I'm a university student pursuing a Robotics Degree. Here are some coding projects I've done so far.

## Slot Machines (Python)

This is a text based slot machine code that can be run on terminal. The user can deposit money to a balance and bet lines and the amount money to bet for each line.

## Banking Management System (C++)

This is a text based Banking Management System using data structures, Binary search tree and queue. This is a class project that is required to have two data structures minimum. I used the queue structure for the purpose of processing and BST for storing the information of the accounts including name, account number, and amount 

## Flask Application (Python)

This is my first time using Flask I'm learning on my own. Learning the framework and possibly doing a simple project on my own.

## Password Generation (Python)

This is a simple password generation code using python in the terminal. This is to try out python more and doing more python related projects to familiarize with the language.

## Othello 

Othello is a board game in C++ using openFrameWorks I've done for a class project.

## Light Control

Light Control was a class project to control the light using Serial Interfaces(UART, SPI, I2C), Data Conversion(ADC) and PID control.
The components used:
- TM4C123GXL microcontroller
- phototransistor
- 2.2k ohm resistor
- 1uF capacitor
- Temperature Sensor
